This example demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Ruby related to directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set`.  While this method provides a way to modify internal state, it undermines the principles of encapsulation and can make code harder to maintain and debug.  The solution showcases a preferred approach using accessor methods to ensure controlled access to instance variables.
